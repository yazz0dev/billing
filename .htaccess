# This file enables clean URLs and routes requests to your front controller (index.php)
# Requires mod_rewrite enabled in httpd.conf and AllowOverride set for this directory.

    RewriteBase /

    # --- Rewrite Rules ---
    # Send all requests not for existing files or directories to index.php

    # Check if the requested path is NOT a file
    RewriteCond %{REQUEST_FILENAME} !-f
    # Check if the requested path is NOT a directory
    RewriteCond %{REQUEST_FILENAME} !-d

    # If it's neither a file nor a directory, rewrite the request to index.php
    # The [L] flag stops processing further rules if this one matches.
    RewriteRule ^(.*)$ index.php [L]

    # OPTIONAL: If your framework uses PathInfo (e.g., index.php/route/params)
    # and the above rule sends requests like /about/us to index.php
    # but the framework needs to see it as index.php/about/us, you might need:
    # RewriteRule ^(.*)$ index.php/$1 [L,QSA]
    # But for most modern frameworks, the first simpler rule is sufficient
    # as they read $_SERVER['REQUEST_URI'].
    # Use the simple RewriteRule ^(.*)$ index.php [L] first and see if it works.

# Optional: Add other configurations here if needed, e.g.,
# - Deny access to specific files/directories
# - Custom ErrorDocument directives
